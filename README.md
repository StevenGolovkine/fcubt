# FCUBT: Functional Clustering using Unsupervised Binary Trees

Note that, the algortihm FCUBT requires the version 0.8.7 of FDApy to be runnable. To install this version, run

    pip install FDApy==0.8.7


This repository hosts the source code for the results reproducibility of the simulated and real datasets that are presented in the paper: *Clustering multivariate functional data using unsupervised binary trees*. 

Link to the preprint: `https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.05973`.

## Installation

To get the latest version of the code, please run un a terminal:
    
    git clone https://github.com/StevenGolovkine/fcubt.git


## Analysis of rounD dataset

The folder _round_ gathers Juypter Notebooks to reproduce the analysis of the rounD dataset done in the paper. Check out the website `https://www.round-dataset.com` to get the data. Here, we only consider the recording 00 of the dataset. 

## Analysis of Canadian weather dataset

The folder _canadian_weather_ gathers Jupyter Notebooks to reproduce the analysis of the clustering of the Canadian weather dataset that is provided in the Supplementary Material of the paper.
